# Hexamita_inflata-submission-ENA-2023-06
Submission of odd intron free de novo genome assembly with raw data to ENA

This is a description of the submission process of a de novo assembly genome to ENA on the species Hexamita inflata. The reason for the documentation is due to the genome being virtually intron free, or containing very short intron segments (< 10 bp).
