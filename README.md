# Hexamita_inflata-submission-ENA-2023-06
Submission of odd intron free de novo genome assembly with raw data to ENA

This is a description of the submission process of a de novo assembly genome to ENA on the species Hexamita inflata. The reason for the documentation is due to the genome being virtually intron free, or containing very short intron segments (< 10 bp).

Data belongs to Redmine #6700 (initiated 2023-03-14).

# DNA seq
- Illumina MiSeq
- PacBio RSII
- Oxford Nanopore

# RNA seq

Contact information for the project was a PhD who was only involved in the analysis part. Other information was obtained by proxy of the PhD from other project participants. This is a common setup and not very smooth in terms of information transfer between people involved.

# Initial contact and orientation (2023-03-15 - 2023-03-17)
First contact with PhD was made in 2023-03-15 by mail to arrange meeting to sort out details on the submission process. DS and PhD agreed for DS to be broker using the PhD ENA credibilities. Project lacked Uppmax resources and data was agreed to be transferred to the DS to facilitate the submission (non-sensitive).

# Data Transfer (2023-03-19 - 2023-04-03)
Data transfer was semi-complicated due to this being a non-Uppmax project. Solution was to use Uppsala Box. Issues on the PI-side delayed the transfer with ~1 week.

# Validation of data
